## üß™ Testing with Sample PDFs

### Manual Testing

1. Place sample PDFs in `sample-invoices/` folder
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3002/invoices
3. Upload each PDF
4. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Correct contractor detected
   - ‚úÖ Invoice data extracted accurately
   - ‚úÖ Property matched (if address is in client database)
   - ‚úÖ Running totals update correctly

### Programmatic Testing

Create a test script:

```javascript
const invoiceParser = require('./dist/services/invoiceParserService');

(async () => {
  const result = await invoiceParser.default.parsePDF(
    './sample-invoices/travis-invoice.pdf',
    'travis'
  );
  console.log(result);
})();
```

- Example: "Sparklawn 41" ‚Üí "Nate Green, 21 S Mission Hills"
- Manual mapping interface for unmatched properties

### Phase 4: Accounting Integration
- Export to QuickBooks/Xero
- Generate payment reports
- Tax documentation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### PDF Not Parsing Correctly

1. Check if PDF is text-based (not scanned image)
2. View raw text extraction:
   ```javascript
   const text = await invoiceParser.extractRawText('path/to/invoice.pdf');
   console.log(text);
   ```
3. Adjust regex patterns in `invoiceParserService.ts` if needed

### Property Not Matching

1. Check client coordinates cache exists:
   ```
   ../sparklawn-website-manager/client-coordinates-cache.json
   ```
2. Review address format in PDF vs. client database
3. Use manual property mapping (future feature)

### Upload Fails

1. Check file size (max 10MB)
2. Ensure `uploads/invoices/` directory exists and is writable
3. Check server logs for detailed error

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check server logs: `logs/` directory
2. Review `CONTEXT_FOR_CLAUDE.md` for system architecture
3. Open issue in project repository
